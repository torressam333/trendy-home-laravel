        <p class="lead">Hello!
            We would like to take this time to introduce ourselves.
            We are the brains and braun behind The Trendy Home Collective.
            Best friends who live 5 minutes from each other in the beautiful greater Palm Springs Area;
            We both carry on full time jobs during the day, real estate agent and police officer.
            Our passion for DIY really developed when we became tired of scrolling and pinning projects on Pinterest
            that we would get around to "someday". We have now stopped scrolling and began building,
            not only in our homes, but the homes of friends, family and clients who share the same passion!

                                area
                                when she was 24 after marrying her high school sweet heart. She fell is love with the
                                eclectic trends and incredible weather that the valley had to offer. She and her husband
                                have a beautiful daughter who she enjoys spending her free time with. Other hobbies of
                                Akeira's include baking, spending time with friends, and anything outdoors! She and her
                                husband finally purchased their forever house last summer and she has been very eager to
                                add her personal touches to make it home! When she was just a girl she would arrange and
                                rearrange her room constantly and that is where her love for decor originated. Over the
                                years friends and family began asking for her help to transform their homes as well, and
                                from their with the help of her best friend the Trendy Home Collective was born! </p>
